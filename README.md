# guessNumberProject
Small project where user is guessing random number

User is guessing a random number in range between 1 and 20.
Everytime user checks the guessed number, if it is uncorrect, message will be shown if the entered number is greater or less than the one to be guessed.
Every user attemp reduces highscore by 1.
When user guesses the number, screen will become green with message and the random number will be revealed in the central square.
Highscore is "remembered" as long as application runs without refreshing the browser.
There is also feature "Again!" in the top left corner that resets current game(turn).
